# Architecture diagrams

Place a diagram of the agent's tool-calling flow here (e.g. `smart_assignment.png`).

The current architecture is a single ADK `LlmAgent` (`smart_assignment/agent.py`)
that talks to the user and calls one tool per step, in order:

```
intake_customer            (code — validate/merge address, cases, preferred slot)
find_candidate_routes      (code — geocode + Top-N nearest routes)
evaluate_and_score_routes  (code — HARD constraints, then weighted scoring)
recommend_or_escalate      (code — rank + total-score gate -> decision + reasoning)
  -> requires_human_review? -> agent calls request_input (ADK built-in, human input)
```

The agent (the LLM) decides *when* to call which tool and narrates the
result in conversation; it never computes a distance, a constraint check, or
a score itself -- every number comes back from the tool call. See
`smart_assignment/tools/slot_recommendation.py` for the tool implementations
and `smart_assignment/prompts.py` for the instruction that enforces this.

Reasoning (the natural-language trace on the final recommendation) is
produced deterministically inside `recommend_or_escalate` and then narrated
by the agent; the pipeline's own optional LLM-narrated reasoner
(`reasoning.LLMReasoner`, with a deterministic fallback) is a separate,
lower-level option used when calling `pipeline.run_slot_recommendation(...)`
directly (e.g. `scripts/run_local.py`), not by the conversational agent.

No image file is included in this package — generate one (e.g. via the
ADK Web UI's trace view, or any diagramming tool) and drop it here as
`smart_assignment.png` once available.
